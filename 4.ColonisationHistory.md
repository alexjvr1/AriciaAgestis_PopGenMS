# UK colonisation history

Where were the new populations colonised from? We will use fastSimCoal to estimate the most likely colonisation history. 

We do not have the ancestral state, so I have to generate the [folded SFS](https://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/SFS_&_FSFS.html) for each of the populations or groups of populations. That is, if all derived alleles are identified as compared with Indiv 1 (a random indivi in the population), then the frequency of the derived alleles are combined for classes i and (n-i), where i is the number of indivs in the population. 

An [example paper](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.14951#nph14951-fig-0002) from the Sork lab. 

1. The dataset is filtered to remove any loci under selection

2. Populations are downsampled to exclude all missing data using a python script available from the paper. 

3. To exclude linked loci only one variant is included per RADtag. 



## Scenarios

We're testing three main scenarios. 

1. Col from the south northwards

2. Col from the east

3. Col from the north. 

We'll also include colonisation from all three with mixture between them.

## Folded SFS

Input data needs to be filtered, and the the (joint) folded SFS should be calculated for each of the groups of populations. 

1. North old

2. South old

3. HOD

4. New
