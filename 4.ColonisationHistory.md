# UK colonisation history

Where were the new populations colonised from? 

Rita will use fastSimCoal to estimate this. 

I have to generate the folded SFS for each of the populations or groups of populations

An [example paper](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.14951#nph14951-fig-0002) from the Sork lab. 

1. The dataset is filtered to remove any loci under selection

2. Populations are downsampled to exclude all missing data using a python script available from the paper. 

3. To exclude linked loci only one variant is included per RADtag. 



## Scenarios

We're testing three main scenarios. 

1. Col from the south northwards

2. Col from the east

3. Col from the north. 

We'll also include colonisation from all three with mixture between them.

## Folded SFS

Input data needs to be filtered, and the the (joint) folded SFS should be calculated for each of the groups of populations. 

1. North old

2. South old

3. HOD

4. New


### Data filtering:
