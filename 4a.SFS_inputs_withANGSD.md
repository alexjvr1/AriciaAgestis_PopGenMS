# Creating SFS inputs with ANGSD

We decided to use Angsd for the SFS for Brown Argus because the ddRAD data is very gappy - i.e. there is a lot of missingness in the data. 

First compile a list of bamfiles for the individuals from the final dataset for the rest of the paper: BA261
```
on BlueCrystal

bluecp3:/newhome/aj18951/1a_Aricia_agestis_PopGenomics/ANGSD/BA261.bamlist
```

Then generate SFS for all indivs in the bamlist by parallelising across the regions in the genome (as defined by the regions file from previous variant calling analyses. 
Use [this](https://github.com/alexjvr1/AriciaAgestis_PopGenMS/blob/master/angsd.sfs.sh) script.
