# Manhattan plots 

Aim: Draw manhattan plots for Host Plant and Col Hist variants. 

1. Calculate per variant Fst for all loci based on a) Host Plant, and b) Col Hist

2. Plot Fst across the genome

3. Highlight Bayescan outliers.

4. Size proportional to Bayescan output. 



## 1. Pairwise fst across all loci
