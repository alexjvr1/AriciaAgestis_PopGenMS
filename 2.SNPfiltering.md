# Filtering raw SNP file 

Filtering variants from the raw vcf output to produce two datasets: 

1) Population structure analyses (little missing data)

2) Signals of selection (include as many loci as possible). 


### Filters to apply

1) Minor allele frequency of 5% 

2) Remove individuals with >80% missingness

3.1) Pop gen: remove loci with >50% missingness

3.2) Analyses: remove loci with > 30% missingness


#### Minor allele frequency
