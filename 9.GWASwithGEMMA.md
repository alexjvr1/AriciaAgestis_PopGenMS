# GEMMA

I'll use [GEMMA](https://github.com/genetics-statistics/GEMMA/blob/master/doc/manual.pdf) to estimate the proportion of variance explained by the genetic data (PVE), and identify the most 
important loci associated with host plant choice for the A.agestis dataset. 


Gemma requires complete datasets (no missing data), hence I have to impute missing genotypes in the dataset.
