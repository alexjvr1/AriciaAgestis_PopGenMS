# GEMMA

I'll use [GEMMA](https://github.com/genetics-statistics/GEMMA/blob/master/doc/manual.pdf) to estimate the proportion of variance explained by the genetic data (PVE), and identify the most 
important loci associated with host plant choice for the A.agestis dataset. 


Gemma requires complete datasets (no missing data), hence I have to impute missing genotypes in the dataset. 


## Imputing genotypes in ddRAD dataset



## Add phenotype data 

Need a text file with three columns: family ID, indiv ID, and phenotype. See [PLINK manual](http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/data.shtml). 

We have phenotypes for most but not all of the genotyped individuals (250/261 indivs). Maaike sent the Phenotype file on 13 June 2019 (HPPdata.xlsx).
