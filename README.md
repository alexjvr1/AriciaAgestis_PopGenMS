Data processing and analyses for the manuscript: 

De Jong M, Jansen van Rensburg A, Bridle J (20xx) Few genes of large effect underpin specialisation on host plant in the Brown Argus butterfly in the UK. 


## 1.RawData_to_Variants.md

Processing of raw Illumina data to a variant file. 

## 2.SNPfiltering.md

Filtering of SNPs for 1) population genetic analyses, and 2) outlier/Environmental association analyses. 

## 3.GeneticDiversity&Structure.md

1) Estimates of genetic diversity

2) Genetic distance between populations (Fst)

3) Estimate of Isolation by distance

4) PCA

5) fineRADstructure

## 4.ColonisationHistory

How did A.agestis colonise the UK? 

  - fastSimCoal analyses


## 5.SpecialisationAtRangeMargin.md

Are the environments significantly different between newly colonised and established sites? 

  - PCA of new vs old landscapes

Have population at the range margin become specialised? What are the main drivers of genetic divergence here? 

   - Redundancy and partial Redundancy analyses


## 6.AdaptationtoHostPlant.md

Has A.agestis specialised on new host plant at range margins? 

   - Environmental Association Analysis
      
      Identify outliers
